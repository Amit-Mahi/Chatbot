# Chatbot
 I'm building a chatbot from strach 


## SOP - Structural Operational Procedure
1. we create data.json file and prepare a training dataset.
2. we move that training dataset in the folder name("data").
3. we create a file to work as a pipeline to feed the training data to the selected model.
4. we name that file config.json and we declare pipeline(which is model), Path (of the model after training) and data( path of the training dataset).



## To visualize the Training data use (Library)
- Rasa NLU Trainer

## PipeLine
- We Are Using TensorFlow Embedding.
